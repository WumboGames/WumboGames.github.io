				Congradulations to Homestead for winning (solving the entire set!), Whitefish Bay for placing second, and Madison West for placing third. 
				Also, congrats to all teams for being able to solve at least one problem!

				For those who were wondering, penalty points are scored in the typical ACM-ICPC style. Teams get 1 penalty point per minute it 
				takes them to solve a problem they end up solving, plus 20 penalty points per incorrect submission on a problem they end up solving.
				Problems a team does not solve do not contribute to their score at all.
				The winner is the team that solves the most problems. If there is a tie here, the winner is the team with fewest penalty points.
