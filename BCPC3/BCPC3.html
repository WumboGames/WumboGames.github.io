				Congradulations to Comrades (Colten Webb, Amogh Bhatnagar, Shailesh Desai, and Bill Rui) for winning, 
				redpwn (Hye Sung Jung and Jacob Farrell) for getting second, and Dream Team Lite (Thomas Harmeyer, Nabil Hussani, Monish Kahlia, and Kevin Song) 
				for getting third!
				Also, congrats to all teams on their strong performance on this challenging set! We would also like to give an honorable
				mention to European Gang (Stepan Lukashev and Leonarda Pribanic) for solving 4 problems despite encouring issues in different versions of compilers.
			</p>
			<p class="normal">
				In the scoreboard to the left, H corresponds to problem Three, and G to problem Window; the rest are in the same order as the problem set.
			</p>
			<p class="normal">
				For those who were wondering, penalty points are scored in the typical ACM-ICPC style. Teams get 1 penalty point per minute it 
				takes them to solve a problem they end up solving, plus 20 penalty points per incorrect submission on a problem they end up solving.
				Problems a team does not solve do not contribute to their score at all.
				The winner is the team that solves the most problems. If there is a tie here, the winner is the team with fewest penalty points.
				The scoreboard here reflects the final score, with the exception that it shows a total of 7 wrong submissions by European Gang
				that were due to compiler differences and were not included in the final score. This did not change the final ranking of teams.
