				Problem 1: Passing Bills. This was the input/output problem of the set. The problem consisted of inputting two numbers
				and printing the first of them.

				Problem 2: Apple-Pen. This was the string manipulation problem of the set. This problem required knowledge of text
				input using the java.util.Scanner class, as well as string concatination (the '+' operator for Strings), and either
				the substring method or the split method.

				Problem 3: The Halting Problem. This problem could have been solved in several ways, as discussed in the problem
				analysis. Valid solutions involved either using nested loops, or sorting and using a single loop.
			</p>
			<p class="normal">
				For those of you who may be inclined to fact-check me, I misspoke here in the beginning of the video. The Halting
				Problem was proved unsolvable by Alan Turing, not Charles Babbage. I must have seen the Babbage's name in the first
				line of the problem and accidentally said it instead.

				Problem 4: One. This was the obligatory problem concerning the random mathmatical properties of an arbitrary number,
				in particular, the number 1. In addition to several other properties, 1 is the only natural number that is neither
				prime nor composite, so this problem required a program that could efficiently find whether a number was prime,
				composite, or neither. Because the input was very large, however, this required the program to be efficient in choosing
				which numbers to check.

				Problem 6: Calculatus Eliminatus. This problem involved finding the location of a missing object by eliminating all of
				the places it couldn't be. One solution was based on a decrease-and-conquere approach and involved combining ranges that
				werea adjacent to each other, while the another valid solution was based on the properties of ranges once they had been
				sorted in a certain manner.

				Problem 7: Bike Race. This was a graph theory problem that required finding the diameter of a graph.
				The algorythm used in the video and problem analysis is known as the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm">Floyd-Warshal algorythm</a>,
				which along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's algortyhm</a>
				is incredibly helpful for solving most graph theory problems. While several teams got quite close, no
				teams were able to submit a correct solution to this problem during the competition.
